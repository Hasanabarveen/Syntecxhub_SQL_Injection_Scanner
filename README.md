👉Project Architecture:

The SQL Injection Scanner follows a modular and straightforward architecture.
The user provides a target URL as input to the scanner.
The tool injects predefined SQL payloads into request parameters.
Responses from the web application are analyzed to detect SQL-related errors

⏳Project Workflow:

First, the scanner reads the target URL provided by the user.
Next, SQL Injection payloads are appended or injected into parameters.
The application response is checked for database error patterns.
Finally, the scanner reports whether a potential vulnerability exists.

📤Learning Outcomes:

Through this project, learners understand how SQL Injection attacks work.
It improves knowledge of web application input handling and validation.
Students gain hands-on experience with Python and HTTP requests.
The project strengthens ethical hacking and secure coding awareness.


🧾Final Project Explanation

This project presents a Python-based SQL Injection Scanner that automates vulnerability detection in web applications. It helps identify insecure input handling by testing common SQL payloads and analyzing responses. Designed for educational use, the project provides practical exposure to ethical hacking and web security fundamentals.

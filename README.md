Project Description

This project is a SQL Injection Scanner developed using Python.
It is used to identify basic SQL Injection vulnerabilities in web applications.
The project helps students understand ethical hacking concepts.
It focuses on learning secure input handling and web security basics.



Requirements Used

Python is used to implement the scanner logic.
The requests library is used to send HTTP requests to web applications.
SQL payloads are used to test input parameters.
These requirements help analyze application response behavior.



How the Project Works

The user provides a target web application URL.
The scanner injects SQL payloads into input parameters.
It checks the server response for SQL related errors.
Based on the response, the vulnerability is identified.



Final Output

The scanner displays whether the application is vulnerable or safe.
It helps identify insecure input handling issues.
This allows developers to apply proper security fixes.
The project improves awareness of web application security.

This project is intended only for educational and learning purposes.
Do not use this tool on real websites without proper authorization.
